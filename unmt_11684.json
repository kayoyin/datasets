His popular fame as a great logician rests chiefly on the maxim attributed to him and known as Occam's razor. The term \"razor\" refers to distinguishing between two hypotheses either by \"shaving away\" unnecessary assumptions or cutting apart two similar conclusions.

The problem can be equivalently formulated as: given the integers or natural numbers formula_3 does any subset of them sum to precisely formula_4? Subset sum can also be thought of as a special case of the knapsack problem. One interesting special case of subset sum is the partition problem, in which formula_4 is half of the sum of all elements in the set (i.e., formula_6).
